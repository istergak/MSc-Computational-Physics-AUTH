This directory contains all the material for the 2nd project

# **Brief discription**

This project is divided in two parts. The first part's goal was the use of two
machine learning (ML) classification algorithms, for the separation between signal
and background, in the detection of hypersymmetric Higgs bosons senario. We used 
the **SVM** (Support Vector Machine) algorithm and the **RF** (Random Forest) algorithm.
The second part aims to the classification of the same data, but now with the use of an
artificial neural network (ANN). We used the **TensorFlow** neural network.
