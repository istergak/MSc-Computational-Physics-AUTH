This directory contains all the results material for the 1st final project

# **Brief description**

This project's goal was the calculation and visualization of the Roothan-Hartree-Fock 
wave-functions for the elements from $He$ to $Ne$. The electron $œÅ_r$ and momentum $n_k$ 
density distributions are also calculated, along with the Shannon information entropy in 
position space ($S_r$) and momentum space ($S_k$). Finally, an analysis of the total Shannon information 
entropy $S = S_r+S_k$ is made
