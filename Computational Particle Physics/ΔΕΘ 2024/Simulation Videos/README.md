This folder contains the simulation videos for 300 muon trajectories as they pass through the ATLAS detector chambers.
The videos where produced by recording the operation of the .exe file of the **muon_atlas_v3_2.cpp** script and speeding
up the recorded footage by 40 times to match the 10Hz pass frequency (that is 10 muons per second). The files included in the folder are:

1) **ATLAS SIMULATION (10Hz).mp4**: Simulation video of the muon trajectories detection with **10Hz** pass frequency
3) **ATLAS SIMULATION (10Hz music).mp4**: Same as 2) with background music
