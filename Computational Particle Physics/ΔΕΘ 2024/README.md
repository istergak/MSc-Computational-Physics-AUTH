# Brief discription

The folder **Simulation Codes** contains C## scripts for the simulation of the muons trajectories
detection at the ATLAS experimnet at CERN using the ROOT App.

This link leads to a Google Drive folder containing the simulation videos for 300 muon trajectories as they pass through the ATLAS detector chambers. The videos where produced by recording the operation of the .exe file of the **muon_atlas_v3_2.cpp** script and speeding up the recorded footage by 10, 20 and 40 times to match the 4Hz, 7Hz and 10Hz pass frequency (that is 4, 7 and 10 muons per second, respectively). The files included in the folder are:

1) **ATLAS SIMULATION (4Hz).mp4**: Simulation video of the muon trajectories detection with **4Hz** pass frequency
2) **ATLAS SIMULATION (6-7Hz).mp4**: Simulation video of the muon trajectories detection with **7Hz** pass frequency
3) **ATLAS SIMULATION (10z).mp4**: Simulation video of the muon trajectories detection with **10Hz** pass frequency
4) **ATLAS SIMULATION (10Hz music).mp4**: Same as 3) with background music

The **10Hz** video is to be presented at ΔΕΘ 2024 CERN's booth as part of the 70th CERN Founding Anniversary
