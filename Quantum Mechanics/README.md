# **Brief discription**

This folder contains the computational material of the course Quantum Mechanics [ΥΦΕ205] at the MSc Computational Physics AUTh

# **Contents**
[dot_products_hydrogen](https://github.com/istergak/MSc-Computational-Physics-AUTH/blob/main/Quantum%20Mechanics/dot_products_hydrogen.ipynb): **Jupyter Notebook** for the project of the course. The goal of the project was the calculation of the following dot products:<br> *a) <210|x|311><br>
b) <211|x|310><br>
c) <210|y|311><br>
d) <211|y|310>*<br>
in the hydrogen atom (or hydrogeneous atoms in general). Detailed information and instructions are given in the markdown sections of the notebook.
