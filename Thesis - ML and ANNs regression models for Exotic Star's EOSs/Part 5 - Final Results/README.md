# Part 5 - Final Results

In this directory we present our codes for obtaining and illustrating the metrics MSE and MSLE results from all trained regression models. For the Deep Neural Network models we also illustrate their respective learning curves. Finally, we demonstrate the reconstruction of EoSs both for Neutron and Quark Stars.

**Notes**

In order for the codes to run properly, include the following files along with **Jupyter Notebooks** of this directory:

**For Neutron Stars**
