# Part 1: Solving the TOV equations

This directory contains the modules (.py) and Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) we developed in Python for the solution of TOV equations. We include solutions for different models of equations of states (EOSs) and both for Neutron and Quark stars. The solution data are also included in seperate directories.

## Neutron Stars
