# Part 3 - Training and testing machine learning regression models

In this directory we present our codes for building and evaluating machine learning regression models, using our regression data. For more about how these data where produced, see [Part 1](https://github.com/istergak/MSc-Computational-Physics-AUTH/tree/main/Thesis%20-%20ML%20and%20ANNs%20regression%20models%20for%20Exotic%20Star's%20EOSs/Part%201%20-%20Solving%20the%20TOV%20equations%20for%20Hadronic%20and%20Quark%20Stars) and [Part 2](https://github.com/istergak/MSc-Computational-Physics-AUTH/tree/main/Thesis%20-%20ML%20and%20ANNs%20regression%20models%20for%20Exotic%20Star's%20EOSs/Part%202%20-%20Handling%20the%20TOV%20equations%20solution%20data%20for%20Exotic%20Stars).

**Algorithms**

We used the following machine learning algorithms:<br>
->`DecisionTreeRegressor`<br>
->`RandomForestRegressor`<br>
->`GradientBoostingRegressor`<br>
->`XGBRegressor`

**Notes**

Files of regression data and summary results must be included in the same directory with the following modules and notebooks, for the algorithms to run properly.
