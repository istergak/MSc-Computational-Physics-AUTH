## Question 1
Create a programm, where two real numbers are appended as values to the variables a and b. The programm then should calculate and print the value of the expression $(a+b)^2$.

## Question 2
Create a programm, where two numbers are appended as values to the variables a and b. The programm then should switch the values: a should take the value of b and b the value of a.

## Question 3
Create a programm, which reads from the keybord a positive integer number. The programm should then calculate and print the value of the factorial of this number (n!=1*2*3*...*n).

## Question 4
Create a programm, which reads from the keybord a positive integer number in the interval $[2,1000]$ and prints if the number is a prime number.

## Question 5
In order to find the root of a function $f(x)$ using the Newton-Raphson method we execute the following iterative process

$$\begin{matrix} x_{k+1} = x_k - \frac{f(x_k)}{f'(x_k)}, & k=1,2,3,..., \end{matrix}$$

where $f^{'}$ is the derivative of $f$. Create a programm, which finds the root of the function $f(x) = x^3 + x - 3$, starting the iterative process with the value $x_0=1.0$ and terminating the process when $|x_{k+1} - x_k| < 10^{-8}$.
