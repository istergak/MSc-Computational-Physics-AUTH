# Brief discription

This directory contains all the files for the **SET #2** of the course. The goal of this set is to implement
several Monte Carlo simulations using OpenMP, in order to estimate the irrational number of $\pi$. The main tasks
are the analysis of the parallel speedup (when more threads are used) and the analysis of the convergence rate of 
the errors in $\pi$'s estimation
