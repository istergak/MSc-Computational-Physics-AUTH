# Brief discription

This directory contains all the files for the **SET #2** of the course. The goal of this set is to implement
several Monte Carlo simulations using OpenMP, in order to estimate the irrational number of $\pi$. The main tasks
are the analysis of the parallel speedup (when more threads are used) and the analysis of the convergence rate of 
the errors in $\pi$'s estimation

4. [MC_Sim1_exhaust.csv](https://github.com/istergak/MSc-Computational-Physics-AUTH/blob/main/Computational%20Tools/Part%203%20-%20OpenMP/SET%20%232/MC_Sim1_exhaust.csv): a .csv file with data from a recorded Exhaust Monte Carlo session to be used for the speedup analysis. The first column of the data contains the used threads, the second column the maximum number of physical threads, the third column the total generated points at each simulation, the fourth column the estimations of $\pi$, the fifth column the true percent relative errors of the estimations, the sixth the execution times (C meausured) and the seventh the execution times (Python measured)<br>

The first column of the data contains the used threads, the second column the maximum number of physical threads, the third column the total generated points at each simulation, the fourth column the estimations of $\pi$, the fifth column the true percent relative errors of the estimations, the sixth the execution times (C meausured) and the seventh the execution times (Python measured)<br>
